# AI Playground
This project started as a way to solve 8 puzzle but since I discovered that I love AI I decided to make this a compilation of everything I learn related to AI! 

The project currently has the following options:
- A* Search
   - 8 puzzle
     - First Option: Random initial and goal state 
     - Second Option: Input the initial and goal state
   - Shortest path from start to exit on a random generated maze
     - First Option: Generate a random dungeon 
     - Second Option: Generate a random maze
